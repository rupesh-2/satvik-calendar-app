# 🧘‍♂️ Satvik Calendar – A Spiritual Reminder App

**Satvik Calendar** is a simple mobile app that reminds users not to consume non-vegetarian food on Hindu auspicious days such as **Ekadashi**, **Purnima**, **Sora Sharad**, and more.

### 🌿 Why I Built This

As someone who follows spiritual traditions, I often forgot which days were considered pure or "satvik." I built this app to solve a real cultural problem — helping people remember and honor **pavitra din** through respectful, non-intrusive reminders.
